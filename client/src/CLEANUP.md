# Cleanup

This file was created to document the cleanup process of the FairTest project.

## Removed Files

1. Test files:
   - `client/src/App.test.js`
   - `client/src/setupTests.js`
   - `client/src/reportWebVitals.js`

2. Other non-essential files:
   - `client/src/logo.svg`
   - `client/README.md`

## Updated Files

1. `client/src/index.js` - Removed references to reportWebVitals

## Other Changes

1. Removed the `.git` directory from the client directory to make it a regular directory in the main repository
2. Removed the `FairTest-main` subdirectory containing the original code samples
3. Removed the `live-results-demo.html` file

These changes make the project cleaner and more focused on the essential components.
